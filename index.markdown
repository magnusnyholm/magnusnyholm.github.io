      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>New York, The Big Apple, has since the industrialization experienced an enormous amount of air pollution up until the 1960’s. This meant that the city was experiencing incredible amounts of smog and ash rain from garbage incinerating while the fastest growing cause of death was lung related diseases (Dwyer, 2017). New York City (NYC) has therefore in recent years and especially in the last decade been on a mission to decrease the amount of air pollution through several initiatives such as closing coal power plants and initiating regulations for motor vehicles (Varghese, 2022).  The regulations are primarily driven by governmental institutions and initiatives such as One NYC who aims to create a sustainable city(Download Daily Data | US EPA, 2023) . NYC has a dream “to have the best air quality among all large U.S. cities” (Air Quality - Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, n.d.).</p>

      </div>
      <p>When looking into the main particles causing air pollution it is clear that the dominating particle is PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter). It is a main priority of the United States to decrease these fine particulate matters due to their severe effects on human health (see reference 1 on the “facts” tab). NYC has a target to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 before 2030 by 50% from the 2013 concentration levels. This website aims to investigate NYC's development in decreasing the amount of PM2.5 while looking into the impact this might have had on the residents in NYC.</p>
      <p>To analyze the concentration of PM2.5 in NYC, daily measurements from the EPA have been used (United States Environmental Protection Agency) (Download Daily Data | US EPA, 2023b). In order to achieve a holistic overview of the health effects from PM2.5 concentration, the daily measurements have been used in correlation with data for inpatients at hospitals in New York with respiratory diseases coming directly from the New York health data website. Lastly, data containing NYC borough boundaries and national average PM2.5 measures have been used to create specific insights (Borough Boundaries | NYC Open Data, n.d.).</p>
      <h2>Air pollution trends</h2>
      <p>To gain a preliminary overview of the trend and development of PM2.5 concentration in New York City the following plot shows the daily measurements of PM2.5 gathered and averaged from five boroughs in NYC. Furthermore, the limit values from WHO (the World Health Organization) have been marked to increase the understanding of how NYC is performing compared to the recommended PM2.5 concentration levels. The areas are divided corresponding to the following (European City Air Quality Viewer, n.d.):</p>
      <ul>
          <li style="color:green;">Good: For levels of fine particulate matter that do not exceed the annual guideline value of the World Health Organization of 5 μgm3</li> 
          <li style="color:lightgreen;">Fair for levels above 5 and not exceeding 10 μg/m3</li>
          <li style="color:#FFD700;">Moderate: For levels above 10 and not exceeding 15 μg/m3</li>
          <li style="color:orange">Poor: For levels above 15 and not exceeding 25 μg/m3 </li>
          <li style="color:red">Very poor: For levels at and above the European Union limit value of 25 μg/m3.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>Tip: Use your mouse in the interactive range below the plot to see specific time periods.</em></p>
      <p>When assessing the plot compared to the limit values, it is seen that the air quality in NYC generally has become better over time and thereby indicating that the initiatives to reduce PM2.5 pollution is working. Furthermore, it is seen that the majority of the observations lies in the fair and moderate category which all shows that the initiatives have had a positive impact on the air quality in NYC and thereby slowly increased the likelihood of NYC reaching their targets. This positive increase in air quality is also heavily praised and the health commissioner addresses the development in 2019 as “The latest community air survey shows significant improvements over the past nine years in the city’s air, which means better health for New Yorkers” (Report on Air Quality - NYC Health, n.d.). However, the observations still show spikes meaning that even in the later years there have been observations in the “poor” category which is also recognized by the Director of the mayor's office of sustainability as he says “We’re going to keep fighting to protect and improve air quality, because every single person in New York City deserves clean and healthy air” (Report on Air Quality - NYC Health, n.d.-b).</p>
      <h2>Seasonal tendencies</h2>
      <p>The following plots aim to narrow down the main contributors to PM2.5 pollution along with an enhanced understanding of PM2.5 when the concentration is at its highest. The analysis consists of a boxplot and a choropleth map plot.</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="/img/boxplot.html" width="100%" height="500" class="center">
      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>Tip: Use the slider or click play below the plot to see the development of PM2.5 concentration from 2010 to 2020</em></p>
      <p>By examining the boxplot, it is possible to interpret which seasons result in the highest concentration of PM2.5 and how the variance in the observations develop over time. Looking at the plot for year 2010, it is seen that the boxes are much larger compared to 2019 meaning that the observations between 25th quartile and 75th quartile are more densely distributed and the variance thereby seem to decrease quite significantly over time. Furthermore, it is seen that winter and summer seasons are the ones which clearly have the worst air quality as the boxplots are placed higher on the y-axis. These seasonal tendencies can be explained through what is referred to as “heating/cooling seasons”. A study lead by the NYC department of health concluded that “PM2.5 levels tend to be higher in winter and summer than in fall and spring, likely because of increased heating emissions in the winter and increased upwind power sector emissions in the summer cooling season” (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2015). These conclusions are well-aligned with the boxplot analysis conducted above and is supported by the fact that the winter and summer months are by far the seasons where the air condition is used the most resulting in a much higher pollution from energy production.</p>
      <h2>Most air polluted boroughs</h2>
      <p>To get a better understanding of where the concentration of PM2.5 is the highest, a choropleth map plot has been used to show the development in admissions in each borough from 2010 to 2020. This plot can be also useful to provide an insight into the underlying causes of PM2.5 as one would be able to see which specific boroughs have the highest concentration of PM2.5 and thereby identify the main reasons for these high PM2.5 levels.</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="/img/choroplethmap.html" width="100%" height="500" class="center">
      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>Tip: Use the dropdown menu at the top left to select a year and see PM2.5 levels have changed over time.</em></p>
      <p>The colorbar on the right side shows the PM2.5 concentration (micrograms per cubic meter), which is used for coloring and to indicate the average concentration measurements for each borough. For all years, it is clear that Manhattan and Bronx have comparatively high PM2.5 concentration compared to the other boroughs. Manhattan has a higher concentration which according to a study made by NYC health officials can be explained by the density of population along with built-ups and heavy traffic (Chan, 2017). According to the Bronx Times, Bronx has high comparative pollution because of heavy industry, high traffic intersections and waste transfer stations (Times, 2022). However, for all five boroughs, there seems to be an overall downwards trend. In 2010, the average measurements were between 9.1 and 10.7, compared to 2019 which had an average concentration between 6.1 and 7.</p>
      <p>Overall, the PM2.5 concentration between boroughs are not remarkably different, since each of the boroughs all lie around what WHO defines as ‘fair’ pollution levels.</p>
      <h2>New York City vs USA</h2>
      <p>To assess the substantial decrease in air pollution levels and put it into a comparable context, it is interesting to analyze the pollution level in comparison to the national average and thereby determine how NYC compares to the rest of the country. The national average measures is calculated from measures collected at 375 different sites across the United States. These sites are located in rural, urban and suburban areas (Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Trends | US EPA, 2022).</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="/img/barchart_comparison.html" width="100%" height="500" class="center">
      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>NYC vs US PM2.5 comparison</em></p>
      <p>From the plot, it is seen that both the average NYC and national average measures are trending downward in the examined time period. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the NYC average PM2.5 levels were slightly higher than the national average. However, in the period from 2013 to 2020, the average measures fall below the national average as the concentration declines at a faster rate. It is particularly impressive that NYC is below the national average, considering that the NYC measurements are exclusively collected within urban areas with comparatively high population density. As the national average measure includes rural areas, the average values are going to be lower as the population density tends to have lower air pollution (Borck & Schrauth, 2021).</p>
      <p>The trending decrease seen in the PM2.5 measurements, particularly compared to the national average, seems to indicate that the actions that the NYC government has taken to reduce air pollution have been quite effective. As the NYC environmental office had a goal to reduce the PM2.5 concentration by 50% from 2013 to 2030, they appear to be on track as they have reduced it by 25.2% from 2013 to 2019 and thereby have 11 years to decrease the remaining 25%.</p>
      <h2>Have the environmental initiatives had the intended effect?</h2>
      <p>Particles in the PM2.5 size range are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. As explained in reference 1 under the tab “Facts”, exposure to fine particles can cause short-term health effects and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. Scientific studies have linked increases in daily PM2.5 exposure with increased respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, emergency department visits and deaths (Fine Particles (PM 2.5) Questions and Answers, n.d.). This is the key reason for NYC to have initiated the focus on increasing their air quality. In order to analyze if this impressive decrease in PM2.5 has had an impact on the health of New Yorkers the following plot shows the amount of admissions due to respiratory diseases. The plot is divided into the boroughs of NYC to make it possible to assess the amount of admissions per borough with the PM2.5 concentration in each borough and thereby analyze the correlation between PM2.5 concentration and admissions on the hospitals (note that 2020 has been removed from the dataset as this would have an exponential increase due to COVID19).</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="/img/bokeh_stacked.html" width="100%" height="618" class="center">
      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>Tip: Hover your mouse over each section to see detailed information of admissions or click on a borough to highlight the data from that specific borough.</em></p>
      <p>From the plot it is seen that the amount of admissions follows a similar decreasing trend as the concentration levels of PM2.5. This can be scientifically explained by WHO who states that the impact of high PM2.5 levels is seen after 24-hours of exposure, especially for people with asthma and existing respiratory diseases (Inhalable Particulate Matter and Health (PM2.5 and PM10) | California Air Resources Board, n.d.).</p>
      <p>It can be seen that Manhattan is the borough with the largest number of hospital admissions which indicates that there is a correlation between air pollution and admissions given that Manhattan has the worst air quality in NYC. Furthermore, it can be seen that Brooklyn has the second largest number of hospital admissions, even though they are not the borough with the second worst air quality. However, as this data does not consider population density, this does not come as a surprise since the population in Brooklyn is almost double the size of the Bronx (Compare Cities, 2023). Nonetheless, there are several reasons for NYC residents getting respiratory diseases meaning that even though there is a correlation between hospital admissions and air pollution levels, this plot might not tell the whole story.</p>
      <p>Finally, to achieve a greater understanding of the trend of hospital admissions, the distribution of admissions between age groups has been plotted in a bar chart.</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="/img/barchart_age.html" width="100%" height="618" class="center">
      <p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"><em>Tip: Use the slider or click play below the plot to see the PM2.5 concentration from 2010-2020</em></p>
      <p>By looking at the above plot, it can be seen that there is a clear tendency for older people to get admitted to the hospitals for respiratory related diseases. As older people have a more fragile immune system, it therefore makes sense that the number of admissions increases with age. There are several respiratory diseases, such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), that have a clear increase in risk with age (Divo et al., 2022). High amounts of particulate pollution in the air is one of the key risks for developing specifically COPD, as the particles build up in your airways and cause long-term inflammation that restrict airflow (Particle Pollution and Respiratory Effects | US EPA, 2022). In the time period examined, the amount of admissions decreases for all age groups somewhat evenly. However, the age group from 30 to 49 falls a bit more as it decreases from 12.800 to 7.500 admissions which is close to halving the number of admissions over a 10 year period. The remaining age groups all have lower admission numbers in 2019, but the percentage decrease is not as remarkable as in the 30 to 49 age group. As seen in the plot of admissions by year, 2020 is once again an outlier due to COVID-19.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, there has been a decrease in the concentration levels of PM2.5 which does seem to have had a positive impact on the number of admissions for respiratory disease. However, as long term exposure to air pollution is usually what is considered most impactful to the health of citizen, the respiratory disease admissions may continue to decrease in the future as NYC increases the air quality and maybe reaches their vision of having the best air quality among all large U.S. cities (Ηow Air Pollution Affects Our Health, 2023).</p>
