    <h2>PM2.5</h2>
    <p>Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the worldâ€™s leading environmental health risk factor. There are outdoor and indoor sources of fine particles (McDuffie et al., 2021). The outdoor contributors to PM2.5 pollution primarily consists of motor vehicles, construction equipment, trains and other operations which involve the burning of fuels. PM2.5 is also produced by indoor activities such as smoking, cooking, burning candles or oil lamps, and operating fireplaces but these are only a minor contributor to the pollution (Fine Particles (PM 2.5) Questions and Answers, n.d.-b).</p>
    <p>Particles in the PM2.5 size range are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. Exposure to fine particles can cause short-term health effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath. Exposure to fine particles can also affect lung function and worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease (Fine Particles (PM 2.5) Questions and Answers, n.d.-b). Scientific studies have linked increases in daily PM2.5 exposure with increased respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions, emergency department visits and deaths. People with breathing and heart problems, children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM2.5 (Fine Particles (PM 2.5) Questions and Answers, n.d.-b).</p>
